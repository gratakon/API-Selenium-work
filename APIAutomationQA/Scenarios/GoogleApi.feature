#@APIScenario_1
Scenario: TC_01_Add Place_Response Code validation 200 OK
#Given user generate qa authentication token for EISL endpoints
	When base uri is set for "BaseURI" endpoint
	And user set "Addplace" for endpoints
	#And user set authentication token generated in above step
	And user set "QUERY" parameter "key" as "qaclick123" for current endpoint
	And user add request json "AddPlaceAPI.json" to request body
	#And user set proxy details "10.98.21.24" host name and "8080" port
	And user execute "POST" request "with" json
	Then user verifies the response status code as "200"
	And user set api response as input for json schema validation
	When user have swagger yaml "swagger.yaml"available for validation
	When user convert swagger yaml to json schema for object to validate "Relatedpartyresponse" and of object type "object"
	And user add validation options "NO_ADDITIONAL_PROPERTIES,IGNORE_NULL_VALUES" to existing json schema
	
	
	
@APIScenario_2
Scenario: TC_02_Get Place_Response Code validation 200 OK
#Given user generate qa authentication token for EISL endpoints
	When base uri is set for "BaseURI" endpoint
	And user set "Getplace" for endpoints
	#And user set authentication token generated in above step
	And user set "QUERY" parameter "key" as "qaclick123" for current endpoint
	And user set "QUERY" parameter "place_id" as "f187c313e01a6c4a4e67c5bf9673eedb" for current endpoint
	#And user set proxy details "10.98.21.24" host name and "8080" port
	And user execute "GET" request "without" json 
	Then user verifies the response status code as "200"

Scenario: TC_03_Update Place_Response Code validation 200 OK
#Given user generate qa authentication token for EISL endpoints
	When base uri is set for "BaseURI" endpoint
	And user set "Updateplace" for endpoints
	#And user set authentication token generated in above step
	And user set "QUERY" parameter "key" as "qaclick123" for current endpoint
	And user add request json "UpdatePlaceAPI.json" to request body
	#And user set proxy details "10.98.21.24" host name and "8080" port
	And user execute "PUT" request "with" json
